## Project Description

**PwnedChecker** is a tool that I developed in Python for checking if your password has been compromised in any data breaches by leveraging the HaveIBeenPwned API. It creates a SHA-1 hash of the password, sends a request using the first five characters of the hash to the API, and processes the response to determine if the password has been pwned.

## Key Features

- **Password Hashing**: Utilizes `hashlib` for the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to securely hash the user's password.
- **API Integration**: Leverages the HaveIBeenPwned API to verify if the password has been exposed in data breaches.
- **Response Processing**: Parses the API response to find the complete hash and retrieve the count of breaches.
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: Guides the user through the process with clear prompts and informative messages.
